    <h1>Wind Energy</h1>
    <h3>How wind turbines work</h3>
    <p>"Wind turns the propeller-like blades of a turbine around a rotor, which spins a generator, which creates electricity."</p>
    <h3>How wind is created</h3>
    <p>Wind is a form of solar energy which is caused by the sun uneavinly heating the atmosphere and the rotation of the earth.</p>
    <h3>Types of wind turbines</h3>
    <p>There are 2 types of wind turbines. One is a vertical one which is the most common and must be facing the correct dirrection to produce energy. The other is 
        horizantal which is generally much smaller than the vertical ones but they are <em>omnidirectional</em> meaning they do not have to be facing a certain dirrection to produce energy.
    </p>
    <h3>Why use wind energy</h3>
    <p>Wind energy is a <strong><em>renewable</em></strong> source of energy like solar energy. Wind turbines can produce more energy in the same amout of space than solar pannels can. The advantage to using renewable energy sources is that we
        don't have to burn fossil fuels which is one of our planets <strong>precious</strong> recources. Also using wind energy will reduce green house gasses than is causing global warming.

    <h3>Wind Turbine Facts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Most wind turbine parts are manufactured in the USA</li>
        <li>Wind turbine blades are over 200 feet long</li>
        <li>Wind turbines on average are 295 feet tall</li>
        <li>Wind turbines make less noise than cars</li>
