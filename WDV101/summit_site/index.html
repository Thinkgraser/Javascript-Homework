      <p id="intro">
        Summit Farms is recognized for rescuing Alaskan dog breeds such as
        Malamutes and Huskies. Our mission is to adopt and save as many dogs as
        we can.
      </p>

        We believe in helping the helpless and reducing the number of homeless
        dogs while improving the welfare of all domestic animals. Additionally,
        we seek to educate our community on the plight of these animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brad and Janet Harker founded Summit Farms Rescue in 2004. We work to
        foster Respect, Understanding and Compassion for all creatures, and the
        belief that all life is valuable and worthy of protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the founding of Summit Farms, we have adopted more than 2,620 dogs
        and counting.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are grateful for the continued support of our donners. We are
        overjoyed to have so many huskies have new forever homes with caring
        families. Should you have any questions, please feel free to visit our
        contact us page.
