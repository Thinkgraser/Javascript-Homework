      <h4>Training</h4>
      <p>
        Many alaskan dog breeds are very intelegent and hard working dogs but
        they must be trained properly. If not trained properly they can develop
        bad habbits that are hard to break.
      </p>
      <h4>Grooming</h4>
      <p>
        These dogs should be bathed at least once every 6 weeks and brushed at
        least once a week because of their thick coat of fur. Before giving them
        a bath use a hair dryer for a few minutes to blow away any loose hair
        and lossen up the dirt in their thick fur. You should also make sure to
        clean their ears and trim their nails and pads and keep their teeth
        clean.
      </p>
      <h4>Health and Nutrition</h4>
      <p>
        They need a well balanced diet, vitamins, and healthy treats to keep
        them healthy and make sure they get plenty of exercise.
